There might be deeper problems with your virtual environment. It might be corrupted or improperly configured, particularly if it was moved or if files were not fully synchronized with OneDrive.

In such cases, the best approach is usually to recreate the virtual environment:

Deactivate and delete the existing virtual environment:

powershell
Deactivate  # If the venv is activated; if not, just move on
Remove-Item "D:\TUe Project\surveybe\.venv" -Force -Recurse
Recreate the virtual environment at the intended location:

powershell
python -m venv "D:\TUe Project\surveybe\.venv"
Reactivate the virtual environment:

powershell
D:\TUe Project\surveybe\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Reinstall your dependencies:

powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt, you will need to manually reinstall the necessary packages.

Once the environment is set up, try running pip list again:

powershell
pip list
